## Kali from Docker
Not sure I've ever seen this before but it could be handy to package up a Dockerfile with some tools on it so if I'm ever on a fresh or foreign machine I can have everything I need in order to work a target and all I have to remember is where the repo is.

```bash
# Getting set up
docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling
docker build -t kali-test1 .
docker run -it kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash
```

```bash
# Scan an endpoint from the container
docker run -it --rm --network host kali-test1 nmap -sn 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
```
